### How to play:

I'm still looking for ways to publish the game to the public with no bugs, but for now, if you have interest you can:

* Clone this repository with ```git clone git@github.com:RicardoSouza03/Shooter-Game.git```
* Access the folder with the files
* After that I advise that you create a virtual enviroment with venv and inside this enviroment you can use ```python3 -m pip install pygame```
* And now you can run the file *controller.py* with python and play it.

To control you just have to use your mouse, have fun!!
